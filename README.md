This repository demonstrates a common error in Dockerfiles involving multi-stage builds. The original Dockerfile (`Dockerfile`) omits copying the application files from the build stage to the final stage.  This leads to the application not being present at runtime, resulting in an error.  The corrected version (`Dockerfile.fixed`) shows the proper way to copy files to ensure a functional application within the final image.
